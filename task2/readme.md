Task# 2
Task Title: Simple Task Management App With React
Objective: Create a basic task management application frontend using React. The application should allow users to view, add, update, and delete tasks. Data will be managed locally within the React app, without making API calls to a backend.

Task 2: Frontend UI/UX Improvements
Objective: Enhance the user interface and overall user experience of the task management application.
Add visual indicators for different task states (e.g., completed, overdue). Consider using icons or color-coded labels to quickly convey task status.
Introduce smooth transitions and animations between different views or when performing actions like adding, updating, or deleting tasks. This can enhance the overall user experience.
Enhance the task creation and editing forms with better styling, layout, and user feedback. Consider using modal dialogs for a cleaner presentation.
Provide clear feedback to users when tasks are added, updated, or deleted. Implement non-intrusive notifications for successful actions and display error messages in a user-friendly manner.
