Task #8: Fetching Data from JSONPlaceholder API and Displaying in Frontend

Description:

Understanding JSONPlaceholder API:
Take some time to explore the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).
Understand the structure of the data available through various endpoints (e.g., /posts, /comments, /users, etc.).

Fetching Data:
Choose an endpoint from the JSONPlaceholder API to fetch data from. For instance, you could start with /posts to retrieve a list of posts.
Write JavaScript code to make a GET request to the chosen endpoint. You can use the Fetch API or any library/framework of your choice (e.g., Axios).
Handle the asynchronous nature of fetching data and ensure error handling is implemented.

Creating the Frontend:
Design a simple and intuitive user interface using HTML and CSS. Keep the design clean and responsive.
Implement a container element where the fetched data will be displayed.
Use JavaScript to dynamically populate the UI with the data fetched from the API.
Experiment with different UI components (e.g., lists, cards, tables) to present the data in an organized manner.
Consider implementing basic styling to enhance the visual appeal of the page. You can use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap if you're comfortable with them.

Testing and Refinement:
Test the frontend thoroughly to ensure that data is fetched and displayed correctly.
Verify that the UI is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
