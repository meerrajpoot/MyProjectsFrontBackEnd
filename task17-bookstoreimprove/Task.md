Task #17: Implement Advanced Search and Filtering for Bookstore Website Objective: Enhance the bookstore website by adding advanced search and filtering functionalities. This will allow users to easily find books based on various criteria.

Requirements:

Search Functionality:

Implement a search bar that allows users to search for books by title, author, or description. As the user types in the search bar, display a list of matching books dynamically (real-time search). Highlight the matching text within the search results for better visibility. Filtering Options:

Add filtering options to the Books component that allow users to filter books by categories such as genre, publication date, and rating. Implement checkboxes or dropdowns for each filter category to enable multiple selections. Sorting Options:

Provide sorting options to sort the book list by title, author, publication date, or rating. Allow users to sort in both ascending and descending order. UI Enhancements:

Ensure the search and filter UI components are responsive and intuitive. Display the number of results found based on the search and filters applied. Clear button to reset all filters and search criteria. Feedback and Error Handling:

Provide clear feedback if no books match the search or filter criteria. Handle edge cases gracefully, such as invalid search inputs or conflicting filter criteria. Data Persistence:

Use localStorage to save the user's search and filter preferences so that they persist across sessions.
