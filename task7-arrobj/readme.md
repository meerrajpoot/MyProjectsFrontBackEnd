TASK #7 - Advanced JavaScript Object and Array Manipulation

Dynamic Object Creation: Write a function that dynamically creates an object based on user input. The function should prompt the user to enter key-value pairs and construct an object from these inputs. Include error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-string keys or empty values.

Object Inheritance: Create a prototype for a 'Vehicle' object with properties like 'type', 'manufacturer', and 'model'. Extend this prototype to create two more specific types of vehicles, like 'Car' and 'Bike', adding specific properties or methods to them.

Deep Copy of Object: Write a function to perform a deep copy of a nested object. This function should be able to handle nested objects of arbitrary depth and complexity.

Manipulating Array of Objects: Write a function to sort an array of objects based on a specific property, such as sorting books by their year of publication.

Advanced Filtering and Reduction: Implement a function that filters an array of objects based on multiple criteria. Create a function that uses the reduce method to aggregate information from an array of objects for example finding the total number of pages across a collection of books.

Interactive Array Manipulation: Develop a function that allows users to input values to add to an array, providing options to add new items, remove items, or modify existing items in the array.

Error Handling and Debugging: Include comprehensive error handling in all functions, ensuring that they handle unexpected inputs gracefully. Use console logs to debug and track the flow of the functions.
