Task#14 - Advanced React Frontend Project: Interactive Photo Gallery with Hooks

Objective Create an interactive photo gallery using advanced built-in React hooks, focusing on frontend functionalities without backend integration.

Key Features of the Project

Photo Gallery Layout: Design a responsive photo gallery layout using CSS Grid or Flexbox. Implement a modal view for displaying full-size images when a thumbnail is clicked.

Image Lazy Loading: Use the useRef and useEffect hooks to implement lazy loading of images. Images should only load as they come into the viewport to improve performance.

Drag-and-Drop Reordering: Implement drag-and-drop functionality to reorder photos in the gallery. Utilize the useReducer hook for managing the state of the photo array during reordering.

Gallery Filtering: Implement a feature to filter images based on categories or tags. Use the useMemo hook to optimize the filtering process, ensuring efficient rendering.

Keyboard Navigation: Enhance accessibility by adding keyboard navigation (arrow keys) to navigate through the gallery and modal view. Use the useEffect hook to handle keyboard events.

Light/Dark Mode Toggle: Implement a light/dark mode toggle feature for the gallery. Use the useContext hook to manage the theme state across all components.

Deliverables A React-based interactive photo gallery application showcasing the use of advanced hooks such as useRef, useReducer, useMemo, and useContext.
