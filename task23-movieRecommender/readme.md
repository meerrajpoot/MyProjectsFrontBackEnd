Task #23: Develop a Movie Recommendation Application Using React and Material-UI
Objective

Create a movie recommendation application that helps users discover new movies based on their interests. The application should use React for the frontend and Material-UI for styling and UI components. This task will provide experience in building a frontend application with React and leveraging a UI framework for efficient and visually appealing design.

Steps

Set Up the React Environment

Initialize a new React application using Create React App with vite framwork.
use tailwindcss for vite framwork
Install Material-UI library and any additional dependencies required for the project.
Create Components for Movie Recommendation

Design and create React components for displaying movie recommendations, searching for movies, filtering by genre or director, and viewing movie details.
Use Material-UI components such as cards, buttons, forms, and dialogs to create a polished and user-friendly interface.
Integrate with Movie API

Utilize a movie API (such as The Movie Database API or OMDB API) to fetch movie data for recommendations and search results.
Use Axios  API to make HTTP requests to the movie API endpoints and handle responses in the React components.
Implement State Management

Manage the state of movie data within the application using React's built-in state management or a state management library like Redux.
Ensure that changes to movie data, such as fetching new recommendations or updating search results, are reflected in the component state and UI in real-time.
Add Functionality for Movie Management

Implement functionality to search for movies by title, director, or keyword and display the search results dynamically.
Allow users to filter search results by genre, release year, or other relevant criteria.
Implement pagination or infinite scrolling to handle large sets of search results efficiently.
Add Movie Details Page

Create a separate page or modal to display detailed information about a selected movie, including its title, director, description, cover image, and other metadata.
Use routing or modals to navigate to the movie details page from the search results or recommendation list.
Implement Bookmarking Feature

Enable users to bookmark their favorite movies for future reference.
Implement functionality to add or remove movies from the user's list of bookmarks and display bookmarked movies separately from the main list of recommendations.
Use local storage or a client-side database to persist bookmark data across sessions.
Test and Debug

Test the application thoroughly to ensure that all features work as expected and handle edge cases gracefully.
Use tools like React Developer Tools and browser developer tools to debug any issues that arise during development.
Optimize Performance

Optimize the performance of the application by minimizing unnecessary re-renders, optimizing component rendering and updating, and lazy-loading components or resources.
Ensure that the application loads quickly and remains responsive even with a large number of movies or search results.
Deliverables

A fully functional movie recommendation application with a user-friendly interface.
