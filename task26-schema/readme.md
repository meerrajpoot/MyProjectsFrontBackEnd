Task #26: Design MongoDB Schemas and Models
This task introduces you to creating schematics and representing data using MongoDB and its ODM (Object Data Mapper) like Mongoose.

Objective:

Define data structures for your application entities using MongoDB Schemas.
Build Mongoose models to interact with MongoDB collections and documents.
Steps:

Identify Entities:

List the main data entities your application manages (e.g., users, products, orders).
Schema Design:

For each entity, define a schema specifying its properties and data types.
Consider using nested schemas for complex data structures.
Include validation rules to ensure data integrity.
Mongoose Models:

Use Mongoose to create models based on your defined schemas.
The model acts as a representation of a MongoDB collection.
Mongoose provides methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on documents.
Relationships:

Model relationships between entities using references or embedded documents.
Decide between storing related data in separate collections or embedding them within a document.
