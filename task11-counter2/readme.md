Task#11: Enhance the React Counter with Additional Features
Objective: Extend the basic counter application to include additional features such as reset functionality, dynamic step increment/decrement, and counter value limits.

Key Features:

Reset Counter:

Add a button to reset the counter value to zero.
Dynamic Step Value:

Include an input field to specify a step value. The counter should increment or decrement by this step value.
Counter Limits:

Add functionality to set minimum and maximum limits for the counter value. Ensure the counter does not go below the minimum or above the maximum limit.
Requirements:

Update Counter Component:

Modify the existing Counter component to include the new features.
State Management:

Use the useState hook to manage the counter value, step value, and limits.
User Input Handling:

Handle user input for the step value, and ensure the counter updates accordingly.
Deliverables:

An enhanced React application with the extended counter functionality.
Code should be clean, well-organized, and use modern React practices (functional components and hooks).
