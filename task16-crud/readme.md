Task #16: Implement CRUD Operations for Bookstore Website

Objective:
Extend the existing bookstore website by integrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing books.

Requirements:

Create: Develop a form component for adding new books to the bookstore. The form should include fields for title, author, and description. Upon submission, the new book should be added to the list of books displayed in the Books component.

Read: Ensure the existing functionality for viewing books is maintained. Users should still be able to see the list of books and view detailed information about each book.

Update: Enable users to edit the details of existing books. Implement functionality to edit the title, author, and description of a book. This could be achieved through a form that pre-populates with the current details of the book and allows users to make changes.

Delete: Allow users to remove books from the inventory. Implement a feature that allows users to delete a book, removing it from both the list of books and any detailed view of that book.

UI Enhancements: Ensure the user interface remains intuitive and responsive throughout the CRUD operations. Provide clear feedback to users upon successful operations (such as adding, updating, or deleting a book).

Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle scenarios such as invalid form submissions or failed requests.

Data Persistence: Consider implementing data persistence to ensure that changes made by users are saved across sessions. Use browser storage mechanisms like localStorage for this purpose.
