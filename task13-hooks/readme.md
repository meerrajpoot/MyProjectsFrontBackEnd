**#Task13- React Hooks
**
### Task 1: useState
Create a simple counter application. Implement two buttons: one to increment the counter and one to decrement it. Display the current count on the screen.

### Task 2: useEffect
Fetch data from an external API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder) and display it on the page. Utilize useEffect to make the API call when the component mounts.

### Task 3: useRef
Implement a form with an input field. Use useRef to focus on the input field when the component mounts or when a specific condition is met (e.g., a button click).

### Task 4: useMemo
Create a list of tasks with varying complexities (e.g., different lengths of task names). Use useMemo to calculate the total number of tasks and log the calculation only when the tasks array changes.

### Task 5: useCallback
Implement a component that generates a random number when a button is clicked. Use useCallback to memoize the function that generates the random number, preventing unnecessary re-renders.

### Task 6: useContext
Create a simple theme toggler application with light and dark themes. Use useContext to pass the theme state and toggle function down the component tree without prop drilling.

### Task 7: useReducer
Refactor the counter application (Task 1) to use useReducer instead of useState to manage the state of the counter. Implement increment and decrement actions using the reducer.
