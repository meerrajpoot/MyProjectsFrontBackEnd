Task#12: Develop a Weather Forecast Application in React

**Objective:**
Create a weather forecast application using React that fetches and displays weather data for a given location.

**Key Features:**

1. **Location Input:**
   - Provide an input field where users can enter the name of a city to get the weather forecast.

2. **Fetch Weather Data:**
   - Use an API (such as OpenWeatherMap) to fetch the current weather and forecast data for the entered location.

3. **Display Weather Information:**
   - Show the current temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed.
   - Display a 5-day weather forecast with temperatures and conditions.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Handle errors gracefully, such as displaying an error message when the city is not found or the API call fails.

**Requirements:**

1. **API Integration:**
   - Integrate with a weather API to fetch weather data.

2. **Components:**
   - Create separate components for the location input, current weather display, and weather forecast.

3. **State Management:**
   - Use the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage state and handle side effects for API calls.

4. **Styling:**
   - Style the application to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

**Deliverables:**
- A React application that allows users to enter a city and view the current weather and 5-day forecast.
- A styled and responsive user interface.
