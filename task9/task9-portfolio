Task #9 Front-End Portfolio Project Showcase with React

(You can use TailwindCSS, ChakraUI, AntD, MUI, or any other CSS library for standard web design)

Objective: Develop a front-end application using React that serves as a portfolio to showcase projects. The application should allow users to add, view, and delete project details, simulating CRUD operations without an actual backend.

Key Features of the Project:

Project Display: Create a grid or list layout to display projects. Each project item should show essential details like the project title, image, description, and technologies used. Implement a detailed view for each project, displaying more information upon selection.

Add New Projects: Design a form to input new project details, including title, description, image URL, and technologies used. Upon submission, the new project should appear in the projects list.

Delete Projects: Implement a delete functionality for each project, allowing users to remove projects from the list. Include a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental deletions.

Local Storage for Data Persistence: Use the browser's local storage to save and retrieve project data. This will simulate data persistence without a backend. Ensure that the application loads existing projects from local storage on initialization.

Search and Filter Functionality: Add a search bar to filter projects by title or technology. Optionally, include filters or sorting features based on different criteria like date added or technology stack.

Responsive and Interactive UI: Ensure the application is responsive and provides a good user experience across various devices. Consider implementing animations or transitions for user interactions.

Error Handling and Validation: Implement form validation to ensure accurate data entry. Provide user feedback for actions, such as successful addition or deletion of projects.

Deliverables: A front-end React application that serves as a dynamic portfolio to showcase projects. The app should allow users to add, view, and delete project details.
